# QNAP-bliss
QNAP  NAS Installer for Bliss album art  manager.
This package will automatically download the latest Bliss package and install it on a QNAP NAS.
Only tested for x86 QNAP NAS, but should work on any QNAP which supports the necessary Java runtime levels since the default install is not processor specific.

This needs the QNAP QDK to  build the QPKG - see the QNAP Forum for details in installing the QDK and building a QPKG.
